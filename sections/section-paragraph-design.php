            <p class="description text-anim">The lobby is both welcoming and refined, with the gracious scale of a piano
nobile, complete with soaring ceilings and exquisite custom furnishings set
against a refined palette of cerused oak and antiqued mirror wall paneling.
Inspired by the Hotel Lutetia in Paris, the dramatic stone floors are composed of
Calacatta Prima Select, Negro Marquina, and Blue de Savoy marbles.</p>
