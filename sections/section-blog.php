                <p class="title">101 West 78th Street | Stephen Sills</p>
                <p class="description nomargin">The work of renowned interior designer Stephen Sills has been described by Architectural Digest as "a lucid synthesis of opulence, rigor, and surprise." Over the course of his nearly three-decade career, Sills has managed to preserve the classic architectural character of his clients’ residences, while updating their interiors with designs that combine modern and classical components. In his latest large residential project, the new Upper West Side condominiums at 101 West 78th Street, Sills collaborated with the acclaimed firm HTO Architect to preserve the Beaux Arts aesthetic of the historic 1886 brick and terra-cotta building, which also has a 1-story limestone penthouse addition. 101 West 78th Street overlooks the American Museum of Natural History on Columbus Avenue and, thanks to Sills’s expertise, remains a seamless part of the Upper West Side’s historic streetscape, while offering luxury amenities fit for 21st-century New Yorkers.</p>
                <p class="description text-more"><span><br>Sills’s style is deeply rooted in the history of decorative arts and design, reflected in his use of antiques with new fabric and wallpaper patterns. His own Manhattan penthouse, which was featured in T: The New York Times Style Magazine in 2014, reveals his creative approach to incorporating history into contemporary interiors. It has been renovated three times since he moved into it in 1988. The whitewashed walls of his apartment, which are capped with fluted crown molding, frame an 18th-century Louis XVI fireplace and floor-to-ceiling windows draped by light gray curtains. Using a single color palette, Sills connects the authoritative design elements of 18th-century European interiors and historic pieces, like the (headless) Hellenistic statue of a lion, to the 20th-century furniture, which includes a daybed by Art Deco icon Jean-Michel Frank. And in the newly designed dressing room, the walls have been clad in satinwood veneer and dyed green, giving the space a sophisticated jewel-box effect. This ingenious approach provides an elegant backdrop for a painting by Harold Stevenson and a Scandinavian modern secretary. The room is lit softly by an Art Deco pendant fixture by the French designer Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann.<br><br>
					Sills’s signature style synthesizes elements from seemingly disparate parts of the globe and different time periods. Each of the interiors in the 101 West 78 condominiums is a prime architectural space ready for clients to customize and decorate according to their unique tastes—adding their own personal twist to the Beaux Arts masterpiece—and that’s just as Sills wants it. </span></p>
