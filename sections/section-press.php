                <p class="description">The developer of a long-anticipated condominium conversion across the street from the American Museum of
Natural History is aiming for a sellout of $125.6 million, or about $4.5 million per apartment.<br>GTIS Partners, the sponsor who took over the project from controversial developer Newcastle Realty
Services last May, is slated to bring 28 new homes to the market at the property at 101 West 78th Street. The
units will range from one- to four-bedrooms, in addition to a penthouse, according to an offering plan approved
this week by the attorney general. Amenities will include a gym and a childrenâ€™s play area.</p>
